`{summclust}` is an R module for cluster level measures of leverage and influence,
and further implements CRV3 and CRV3J cluster robust variance estimators.

For a quick overview of different CRV estimators, take a look at the [cluster robust
variance estimation vignette](https://s3alfisc.github.io/summclust/articles/Cluster-Robust-Variance-Estimators-CRV-1-3.html).

For a very detailed description of the implemented methods, in particular a
discussion of the different leverage and influence metrics, see:

[MacKinnon, J.G., Nielsen, M.Ø., Webb, M.D., 2022. Leverage, influence, and the jackknife in clustered regression models: Reliable inference using summclust](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03288). QED Working Paper 1483. Queen’s University.

For the Stata version of the package, see [here](https://github.com/mattdwebb/summclust).

## Installation

You can install the development version of summclust from [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [r-universe](https://r-universe.dev/) with:

``` r
# from r-universe (windows & mac, compiled R > 4.0 required)
install.packages('summclust', repos ='https://s3alfisc.r-universe.dev')

# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("s3alfisc/summclust")
```

<!-- ## Citation  -->

<!-- If you are in `R`, you can simply run the following command to get the BibTeX citation for `{summclust}`: -->

<!-- ```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE} -->
<!-- citation("summclust") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Alternatively, you can cite the paper by MacKinnon, Nielsen and Webb (2022). In this case, I would be super happy if you mentioned (e.g. in a footnote) that you are using the r-version of `{summclust}`. -->
